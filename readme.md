# Pybasic
I wanna say this language is based on BASIC, but it's really not<br>
My thought process was more like, "Man BASIC is cool... I should another language to fuel my crippling 'making new programming languages' addiction"

Anyway, this is a language, that's for sure<br>

Look mom! I used curly brackets instead of `end` blocks!(YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE)

<br>

## Instructions on using the language
**Requirements**
* Python >= 3.11
* (optional) A cat in your lap

<br>

**Installation**
1. Uhhhh yeah that's not happening(at least not any time soon)

**Building from source**
